# *Optimization*
-> The optimization codes are simple and were made in Julia and Python languages.

* **Optimization Linear**\
         1. Primal ( Julia and Python )\
         2. Dual   ( Julia and Python )
      
* **Optimization Non Linear**\
         1. Method Gradient ( Python )\
         2. Method Newton   ( Julia and Python )\
         3. Method Gradient Conjugate ( Julia and Python )
